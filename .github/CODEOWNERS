# CODEOWNERS helps enforce human review when branch protection enables
# "Require review from Code Owners".
#
# NOTE: Enabling the repository setting "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
# allows the workflow bot to open PRs. To ensure a human must approve, enable
# branch protection with "Require review from Code Owners" and keep this file
# pointing to a human account.
